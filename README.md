## Details
It is a personal voice assistant program made wtith __Python__. It can responses on your commans in a particular way. It is not an AI or made with ML, It is a simple interactive program, Which I started to create from 23 Julay 2020 as a project to boost my skills.

## Features :

### 1. Multiple Modes
 It works on two modes 1.Text Mode and 2.Speak Mode.

### 2. Comminication and Q&A
It can do casual communication and can ans your any Questions that you even don't know about. It can also answer the GK questions. Try asking all type of the questions and observe the responses

### 3. Multimedia
It can play any multimedia that you are having on your device by just saying/typing its name. It can also play the media in the form of a playlist, but the amazing thing is that not only you can create a playlist but __MICHEL__ can also create one for you of its own choices.

### 4. Actions
It can also open/close any programs/file of the device by just giving a command.

### 5. Activity
It stays always awake and ready to response, And work in the background also while you are doing your wor.

## Set Up :
1. First of all you should have installed latest version of Python on your Device. If not then download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/ according to your device. Make sure you check mark __Add tto path__ while installing it.
2. After that open your C-prompt/ IDE terminal window and type this commands.
```
$ python -m pip install â€“upgrade pip
$ pip install pyttsx3
$ pip install SpeechRecognition
$ pip install wikipedia
$ pip install psutil
```
3. Install __sam,mary,mike.exe__ (It is for the voice of the __MICHAEL__, If you want to give him a unique voice then change the id ```engine.setProperty()``` from __-2__ to something else, but the condition is that you should already have some preinstalled voices in your Device.)
4. All the multimedia files on which you want to let __MICHAEL__ have access on must be stored in the __Shared files__ directory.
5. All the Programmes/Files tha you want to close/open must be on your Desktop.
6. Create a __Shortcut__ of the file named __MICHAEL.py__ on your desk top and you can change the icon/name of that shortcut. (I've also provided the icon of __MICHAEL__ in the repo)
7. Launch the __Shortcut__ and you are good to go.

## Commands for Different Tasks :
* You can change to any mode bu entering ```text mode``` or ```speak mode``` or ```change mode```.
* You can ask questions like ```Who is Elon Musk ?``` or can also gives the input in the same way when required.
* When you are using __Speak Mode__, you will see ```Hearing...``` which means __MICHAEL__ is waiting for your reply.
* You can access your multimedial with the command ```play (Name of the audio/video)``` or you can create a playlist by the command ```play a playlist``` and he will ask you to enter the No. and the Names of the songs, or you can also give a command already including the No.
* But when you wants to play any audio/video which are selected bu __MICHAEL__ you have to include a word ```random``` in every commands. ie. ```play a playlist of 50 random songs```.
* You can open/close any program/file by the command ```open (Name of the Program/File Name)``` to open and ```close (Name of the Program/File Name)``` to close it.

## Demerits :
* It's still a prototype not a fully functional program.
* It's still optimise for __Windows__.
* It is Still in development...
